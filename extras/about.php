                <p>ChocoSmith and Confectionery Sdn. Bhd. was created with one single aim – excellence. Since the company was established in 1995, our focus has been to produce the very best chocolates for both the local and global markets.</p>
                <p>Our first factory, in the small town of Desa Serdang located at the southern zone of Kuala Lumpur, was set up in 1995. ChocoSmithstarted out with manufacturing consumer- packed chocolates that were sold mainly to duty-free shops and supermarkets across the country. We have since established ChocoSmithas a major regional chocolatier.</p>
                <p>In 1998, we relocated to our new factory in the Seri Kembangan Industrial Area where we increased our production lines to provide a diverse range of chocolate products to fulfil our promise to offer high quality chocolates to our customers.</p>

                <p>In 2008 and 2013, we opened two more factories to keep up with the growing demands from our customers and to further develop new treats that our customers would love. The new factories helped expand our capabilities to produce more than just consumer-packed chocolates. ChocoSmithnow also produce chocolate for the food service industries and manufacture cookies and other confectionery products.</p>
                <p>From our humble beginnings, ChocoSmith has now become a well-loved consumer brand throughout the country and beyond. Our products have gained the recognition of discerning customers both locally and overseas. ChocoSmiths can now be found in over 15 countries around the world.</p>
                <h4>WHAT WE BELIEVE IN</h4>
                <p>Our vision of being a leading international brand that is associated with high quality chocolate products has been achieved by relying on a simple set of values at every step of our journey – quality, innovation and the very best level of service.</p>
                <p>These are the foundations of our success and are exactly what we deliver to our customers and partners alike. Each and every ChocoSmithproduct carries the promise of offering high quality and delicious chocolates to our customers and we firmly believe that ChocoSmithhas fulfilled that expectation.</p>
